# APPROACH:
#
# 1. ACCEPT THE CIPHER (VHB) (DONE – TESTING NEEDED)
# 2. ACCEPT THE CLUE (VHB)
# 3. DUPLICATE THE CIPHER (VHB)
# 4. PARSE THE CIPHER AT SPACES OR PUNCTUATION INTO AN ARRAY (SS)
# 5. ORDER ARRAY ELEMENTS BY LENGTH (SS)
# 6. COMPARE ORIGINAL ARRAY AND ORDERED ARRAY AND BUILD A DICTIONARY TO REMEMBER ORIGINAL ORDERING (SPK)
# 7. DUPLICATE THE ARRAY (S)
# 8. SUBSTITUTE THE CLUE INTO ALL ARRAY ELEMENTS (S)
# Here on: protect the substituted letter from step 8
# 9(a). COMPARE WITH DICTIONARY TO FIND WORD MATCHES IN ASCENSION OF ELEMENT LENGTH (ARATHI)
# 9(b). RESTART AT ARRAY 0 FOR EVERY FAILED MATCH ENCOUNTERED (ARATHI)
# 10. ONCE ALL ARRAY ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN MATCHED COMPARE ELEMENTS TO THE DICTIONARY AND RE-ORDER ARRAY (SKK)
# 11. CONCATENATE ARRAY INTO A PROPER SENTENCE (SKK)
